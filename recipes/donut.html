        <li>1 (12-count) package Hawaiian rolls</li>
        <li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of 
            each one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger 
            opening and a space large enough to fill each roll with 
            about 1 tablespoon filling.
